				<h2>Data Collection</h2>

					<p> The first project we were asked to complete in 
					<br> Writing & Digital Media was data collection. At first, 
					<br> I was a little intimidated by collecting data on a daily 
					<br> basis and recording every applicable instance. 
					<br> However, I soon realized that it wasn’t as difficult 
					<br> as I had imagined and I actually enjoyed being able 
					<br> to track my behavior with Fitbit. I tracked data in these 
					<br> categories: <strong>Device, Check-Type, Activity-Type, 
					<br> Decision, Rationale, Interface.</strong>
					<br> 
					<br> I also collected data on how many steps I walked, miles
					<br> I walked, calories I consumed, and calories I burned
					<br> along with how many and what type of emails I received
					<br> from Fitbit.

					<p> After my data collection was finalized, I moved onto
					<br> designing my data visualization. This was a very fun
					<br> project for me, and also probably the most challenging. 
					<br> I decided to take my data and place it in the shape of 
					<br> a target, playing off of the idea that Fitbit helps me 
					<br> reach my target goals. Each of the categories mentioned 
					<br> above are placed around the circle and the days of the week 
					<br> are represented by each of the target’s rings.

					<p> Finally, I produced and edited a video about psychographics,
					<br> user personas, and email marketing. The topic tied into Fitbit 
					<br> because during my internship over the summer, I was exposed to 
					<br> Fitbit’s email marketing campaigns and tactics. I enjoyed working 
					<br> on this project because I have always liked working with video 
					<br> software. It was also a chance to learn more about my field of 
					<br>interest, digital marketing.
